# Problem 1
A cup (z=x^2+y^2{0<=z<=1}) is filled with water and slowly tilted. At what angle is exactly half of the water in the cup?

# Problem 2 ("Square root of C")
c>0, n>=1

R_n(c)= sqrt(c+sqrt(c+sqrt(c+sqrt(c+...+sqrt(c)))))

With n radicals. Evaluate

\limit_{n->\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n\prod_{j=k}^n\frac{1}{R_j(c)}
